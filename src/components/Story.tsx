            Lucknow is full of good properties and good deals — what&apos;s
            missing is someone accountable to walk you through it. No blasting
            your number to ten agents. No listings that vanished last month. No
            disappearing after you&apos;ve paid a token. Just one dedicated
            point of contact, from the first enquiry to the day you hold the
            keys — or hand them over.
